Install
======================================

### If you have the Tesla FSD Computer(HW3) installed and/or get black videos, then you'll need to install the H.265 codec. 

* [Microsoft H.265 codec (HEVC Video Extensions)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hevc-video-extensions-from-device-manufacturer/9n4wgh0z6vhq?irgwc=1&OCID=AID681541_aff_7593_159229&tduid=%28ir_wJC0gNTClQca0BAzqwxkEXPhUkjTGXQhW1412Y0%29%287593%29%28159229%29%28%29%28UUwpUdUnU56397YYwYd%29&irclickid=wJC0gNTClQca0BAzqwxkEXPhUkjTGXQhW1412Y0&activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab)

Version 2019.46.6.1 - VLC Support Added
======================================
#### .NET Framework 4.5 must be installed

### [Install VLC 3.X](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html) if not already installed to enable VLC as the video player. Windows Meida Player is still supported but requires all TeslaCam files to be re-encoded before they play correctly, VLC fixes this issue.

## [Windows Installer Version](https://github.com/NateMccomb/TeslaCamViewerII/raw/master/Download/Installer-TeslaCamViewer-2019.46.6.1.zip) - Includes .NET and everything needed for a full install. Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts created
                    
## [Standalone Version](https://github.com/NateMccomb/TeslaCamViewerII/raw/master/Download/Standalone-TeslaCamViewer-2019.46.6.1.zip) - Just unzip and run. Great for keeping a copy on your TeslaCam Flash Drive

## `Tesla's software update 2019.24.4 has changed how the TeslaCam files are saved/encoded.` Use the Re-encode feature to fix these issues when using Windows Media Player as you default video player in TCV.
