Welcome to TeslaCam Viewer II!
Check out the new Join Events feature in 2020.11.0.0
You can now join previously exported clips into one video. 

First 'Export' each camera angle/layout after using the 'Red' and 'Green' markers to adjust the start and stop points of your new video to export. 
Open 'Join Exported Events', this can be found under Application Settings (gear icon) or from the 'Join Events' icon in the 'Export Settings' option.
Add each of your previously exported clips by clicking 'Add Videos' or by dragging and dropping them into the window. (Play order is top to bottom)
Click 'Join All Files' to save all your clips into one video.

I'm currently working on adding a 'TrackMode' feature into TeslaCam Viewer for the P3D owners out there.
You can view a small demo by clicking the 'YouTube Tutorials' button under App settings. 

If you have "TeslaTrackMode" events that you are willing to share for software development, please contact me at TeslaCamViewer@Gmail.com
