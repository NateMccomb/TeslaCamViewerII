Welcome to TeslaCam Viewer II!
This update has been a little over due but it's now released. 2020.11.0.0

Fixed issues when using the Sentry button.
Fixed how TeslaCam Viewer II files are copied to a drive after formatting it.
Increased "Analyzing Files" speed.
New layouts have been added/included. New users will see then already added to the Camera Layouts but users already using TCV will need to import "Layout Config.TeslaCam" under "Application Settings -> Layouts -> Import Layouts" to use them. Users can also add them by resetting all settings (hold SHIFT while starting TCV)

Added a new feature!
You can now join previously exported clips into one video to tell a story using "Join Events". Join Events can be found under Application Settings (gear icon) or from the Join Events icon in the Export Settings option.
