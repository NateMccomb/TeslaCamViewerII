Welcome to TeslaCam Viewer II!
TeslaCam Viewer II - 2019.52.0.0
Updated how TCV detects VLC and if the correct version is installed. 
Unable to find a way to point TCV to a standalone VLC directory so VLC 3.0+ must be installed to take advantage of it.

VLC now allows you to view TeslaCam files instantly instead of needing to re-encode every file.
Windows Media Player is still supported but it is recommended that you install VLC to get the best experience.
